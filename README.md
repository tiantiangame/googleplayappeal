Google Play always terminates the developer account for no reason, I hope everyone will unite and let Google see his mistakes.
I am a google play developer from China, I have been developing apps seriously in Google play for 5 years, and I have accumulated more than 10 million installed users, all the income of my family depends on Admob. But in the last 2 months I have been blocked by google 4 developer accounts, all accounts are blocked for the following reasons:

REASON FOR TERMINATION: Prior violations of the Developer Program Policies and Developer Distribution Agreement by this or associated accounts associated accounts as outlined in previous emails sent to the registered email address(es) of the Publisher account(s).

I swear I have never been suspended by Google for violating the rules, and after several appeals, they have replied to my emails telling me that they did not make a mistake in their decision.

I'm not rich and I can't afford to hire a lawyer to sue them. After the developer account was blocked, my admob account was also blocked and all my income sources were cut off, and I have a 10 month old child. I feel devastated.

I can only ask for help here, and I hope you can help spread the word to let Google staff know their mistake. My English is not good and I am writing this article with the help of translation software. But if I had any other path I wouldn't be here asking for help.



The full story of what happened is.

October 10, 2020.

Developer account (chenjianfang1900@gmail.com) has been terminated.

November 10, 2020.

The developer account (chenjianfang1987@gmail.com) has been terminated.

Developer account: (zhaolin2993@gmail.com ) has been terminated.

January 12, 2021.

Developer account: (chenjianfang1989@gmail.com) has been terminated.

I have never had my account suspended for violating Google Play policies. I wish Google Play would be more humane instead of automatically rejecting us by machine.

I don't know if this article will help me get my account back, but I'm proud of myself for being brave enough to stand up for myself, and I hope that those who have also suffered similar experiences will come forward and unite!
